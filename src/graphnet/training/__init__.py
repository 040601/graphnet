"""Modules for training models.

`graphnet.models` allows for configuring and building complex GNN models using
simple, physics-oriented components. This module provides modular components
subclassing `torch.nn.Module`, meaning that users only need to import a few,
existing, purpose-built components and chain them together to form a complete
GNN
